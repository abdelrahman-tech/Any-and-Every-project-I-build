THIS IS MY SOLUTION FOR "Problem set 5" from "6.001L Fall 2022 Introduction to CS and Programming using Python" course provided by MIT OCW.
I uploaded this specific problem set beacause I found it specially cool. The problem set aimed to teaching us how to read through the documentations and figure out
the suitble function for your project, with an introduction for some forms of pixels' manipulation and steganography.

NOTE: You need to install Numpy and PIL.
